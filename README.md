# binja_minidump

[minidump](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/debug/minidump-files) loader for binja

i wanted to make a python alternative to this rust minidump loader [plugin](https://github.com/cxiao/minidump_bn).

this plugin is based on the [minidump](https://github.com/skelsec/minidump) python library, which is vendored into this repo for maintenance.
